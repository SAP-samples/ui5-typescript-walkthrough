# UI5 Tutorials

In this tutorial we'll introduce you to all major development paradigms of OpenUI5. <details class="ts-only"><summary>This section is relevant for TypeScript only</summary><span>We'll also demonstrate the use of TypeScript with OpenUI5 and highlight the specific characteristics of this approach.</span></details>

## Description

We first introduce you to the basic development paradigms like *Model-View-Controller* and establish a best-practice structure of our application. We'll do this along the classic example of “Hello World” and start a new app from scratch. Next, we'll introduce the fundamental data binding concepts of OpenUI5 and extend our app to show a list of invoices. We'll continue to add more functionality by adding navigation, extending controls, and making our app responsive. We'll also have look at the testing features and the built-in support tools of OpenUI5.

## Tutorials

This repository contains following tutorials:
- [Quickstart](./packages/quickstart/)
- [Walkthrough](./packages/walkthrough/)
- [Navigation and Routing](./packages/navigation/)
- [OData V4](./packages/odatav4/)

## Running locally

The repository is set up as an npm workspaces monorepo. Each tutorial step under `packages/*/steps/*` is a self-contained app you can run standalone, and the root build orchestrator produces a unified preview that mirrors the published GitHub Pages site.

```sh
# 1) install dependencies for every step
npm install

# 2) build every tutorial step (produces dist/<tutorial>/build/NN/ apps + ZIP downloads)
npm run build

# 3) serve the rendered tutorial pages with working Live Preview links
npm start
```

After `npm start`, open <http://localhost:1337/packages/walkthrough/> (or any other tutorial's `packages/<name>/`). The dev server renders the markdown overview, rewrites the published `https://ui5.github.io/tutorials/...` URLs to point at the local `dist/`, and serves the built apps from the same origin.

To run a single step directly without going through the build:

```sh
npm start -w ui5.tutorial.walkthrough.step15
```
