## Step 27: Unit Test with QUnit

Now that we have a test folder in the app, we can start to increase our test coverage.

Actually, every feature that we added to the app so far, would require a separate test case. We have totally neglected this so far, so let’s add a simple unit test for our custom formatter function from Step 23. We will test if the long text for our status is correct by comparing it with the texts from our resource bundle.

> 📝 **Note:** <br>  
> In this tutorial, we focus on a simple use case for the test implementation. If you want to learn more about QUnit tests, have a look at the [Testing Tutorial](https://sdk.openui5.org/topic/291c9121e6044ab381e0b51716f97f52.html) tutorial, especially [Step 2: A First Unit Test](https://sdk.openui5.org/topic/b81736e0fcb246efb3b0cf0ca422f8fd.html).

### Coding
  
We add a new folder `unit` under the `test` folder and a `model` subfolder where we will place our formatter unit test. The folder structure matches the app structure to easily find the corresponding unit tests.

<sup>*Folder Structure for this Step*</sup>

***

### webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.ts \(New\)

We create a new `formatter.ts` file under `webapp/test/unit/model` where the unit test for the custom formatter is implemented. The formatter function that we want to test is from the `formatter.ts` file located in the `webapp/model` folder.

The new formatter file just contains one QUnit module for our formatter function and one unit test for the formatter function. In the implementation of the `statusText` function that we created in Step 23, we use the translated texts when calling the formatter. As we do not want to test the SAPUI5 binding functionality, we just use text in the test instead of a `ResourceBundle`.

Finally, we perform our assertions. We check each branch of the formatter logic by invoking the isolated formatter function with the values that we expect in the data model \(`A`, `B`, `C`, and everything else\). We strictly compare the result of the formatter function with the hard-coded strings that we expect from the resource bundle and give a meaningful error message if the test should fail.

```ts
import ResourceModel from "sap/ui/model/resource/ResourceModel";
import Controller from "sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller";
import formatter from "../../../model/formatter";

QUnit.module("Formatting function", {});

QUnit.test("Should return the translated texts", (assert) => {
    const resourceModel = new ResourceModel({
        bundleUrl: sap.ui.require.toUrl("ui5/walkthrough/i18n/i18n.properties"),
        supportedLocales: [
            ""
        ],
        fallbackLocale: ""
    });

    const controllerMock = <Controller> <any> {
        getOwnerComponent() {
            return {
                getModel() {
                    return resourceModel;
                }
            };
        }
    };

    // System under test
    const fnIsolatedFormatter = formatter.statusText.bind(controllerMock);

    // Assert
    assert.strictEqual(fnIsolatedFormatter("A"), "New", "The long text for status A is correct");
    assert.strictEqual(fnIsolatedFormatter("B"), "In Progress", "The long text for status B is correct");
    assert.strictEqual(fnIsolatedFormatter("C"), "Done", "The long text for status C is correct");
    assert.strictEqual(fnIsolatedFormatter("Foo"), "Foo", "The long text for status Foo is correct");
});
```

***

### webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.ts \(New\)

We create a new `unitTests.qunit.ts` file under `webapp/test/unit/`.
This script loads and executes our formatter. 

```ts
QUnit.config.autostart = false;

// import all your QUnit tests here
void Promise.all([
	import("ui5/walkthrough/test/unit/model/formatter")
]).then(() => {
	QUnit.start();
});
```

***

### webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html \(New\)

Finally we create a new `unitTests.qunit.html` page under `webapp/test/unit`.

Since we are now in the `webapp/test/unit` folder, we actually need to go up two levels to get the `webapp` folder again. This namespace can be used inside the tests to load and trigger application functionality.

First, we load some basic QUnit functionality via script tags. Other QUnit tests can be added here as well. Then the HTML page loads our `unitTests.qunit.ts` script.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>UI5 TypeScript Walkthrough - Unit Tests</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">

	<script
		id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
		src="../../resources/sap-ui-core.js"
		data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{
			"ui5.walkthrough": "../../"
		}'
		data-sap-ui-async="true"
        data-sap-ui-oninit="module:ui5/walkthrough/test/unit/unitTests.qunit">
	</script>

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.css">

	<script src="../../resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.js"></script>
	<script src="../../resources/sap/ui/qunit/qunit-junit.js"></script>

</head>
<body>
	<div id="qunit"/>
	<div id="qunit-fixture"/>
</body>
</html>
```

The so-called QUnit test suite is an HTML page that triggers all QUnit tests for the application. Most of it is generating the layout of the result page that you can see in the preview and we won’t further explain these parts.

If we now open the `webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html` file in the browser, we should see our test running and verifying the formatter logic.

***

### Conventions

-   All unit tests are placed in the webapp/test/unit folder of the app.

-   Files in the test suite end with `*.qunit.html`.

-   The `unitTests.qunit.html` file triggers all unit tests of the app.

-   A unit test should be written for formatters, controller logic, and other individual functionality.

-   All dependencies are replaced by stubs to test only the functionality in scope.
