## Step 11: Pages and Panels

After all the work on the app structure itâ€™s time to improve the look of our app. We will use two controls from the `sap.m` library to add a bit more "bling" to our UI. You will also learn about control aggregations in this step.

### Coding

### webapp/i18n/i18n.properties

We add new key/value pairs to the '# Hello Panel' section of our text bundle for the start page title and the panel title.

```ini
# Manifest
appTitle=Hello World
appDescription=A simple walkthrough app that explains the most important concepts of OpenUI5

# Hello Panel
showHelloButtonText=Say Hello
helloMsg=Hello {0}
homePageTitle=UI5 TypeScript Walkthrough
helloPanelTitle=Hello World
```
***

### webapp/view/App.view.xml

In your App view, we put both the input field and the button inside a containing control called `sap/m/Page`. The page provides an aggregation to `0..N` other controls called `content`. It also displays the title attribute in a header section on top of the content. The page itself is placed into the `pages` aggregation of another control called `sap/m/App`.

In order to make the fullscreen height of the view work properly, we add the `displayBlock` attribute with the value `true` to the view. The actual content is wrapped inside a `Panel` control, in order to group related content. It displays the `headerText` attribute in a header section on top of the panel.

```xml
<mvc:View
   controllerName="ui5.walkthrough.controller.App"
   xmlns="sap.m"
   xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"
   displayBlock="true">
   <App>
      <pages>
         <Page title="{i18n>homePageTitle}">
            <content>
               <Panel
                  headerText="{i18n>helloPanelTitle}">
                  <content>
                     <Button
                        text="{i18n>showHelloButtonText}"
                        press=".onShowHello"/>
                     <Input
                        value="{/recipient/name}"
                        description="Hello {/recipient/name}"
                        valueLiveUpdate="true"
                        width="60%"/>
                  </content>
               </Panel>
            </content>
         </Page>
      </pages>
   </App>
</mvc:View>

```

The `App` control does the following important things for us:
-   It writes a bunch of properties into the header of the `index.html` that are necessary for proper display on mobile devices.
-   It offers functionality to navigate between pages with animations. We will use this soon.

**Next:** [Step 12: Shell Control as Container](../12/README.md "Now we use a shell control as container for our app and use it as our new root element. The shell takes care of visual adaptation of the application to the deviceâ€™s screen size by introducing a so-called letterbox on desktop screens.")

**Previous:** [Step 10: Manifest (Descriptor for Applications)](../10/README.md "All application-specific configuration settings will now further be put into the manifest. This clearly separates the application coding from the configuration settings and makes our app even more flexible.")
