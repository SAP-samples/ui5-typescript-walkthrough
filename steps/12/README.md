## Step 12: Shell Control as Container

Now we use a shell control as container for our app and use it as our new root element. The shell takes care of visual adaptation of the application to the deviceâ€™s screen size by introducing a so-called letterbox on desktop screens.

### Coding

### webapp/view/App.view.xml

In your App view, we put the `App` control inside a `sap/m/Shell` control.

```xml
<mvc:View
	controllerName="ui5.walkthrough.controller.App"
	xmlns="sap.m"
	xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"
	displayBlock="true">
	<Shell>
		<App>
			<pages>
				<Page title="{i18n>homePageTitle}">
					<content>
						<Panel
							headerText="{i18n>helloPanelTitle}">
							<content>
								<Button
									text="{i18n>showHelloButtonText}"
									press=".onShowHello"/>
								<Input
									value="{/recipient/name}"
									description="Hello {/recipient/name}"
									valueLiveUpdate="true"
									width="60%"/>
							</content>
						</Panel>
					</content>
				</Page>
			</pages>
		</App>
	</Shell>
</mvc:View>
```

The `Shell` control is now the outermost control of our app and automatically displays a so-called letterbox, if the screen size is larger than a certain width.

> :information_source: **Note:**
> We don't add the `Shell` control to the declarative UI definition in the XML view if apps run in an external shell, like the SAP Fiori launchpad that already has a shell around the component UI.
There are further options to customize the shell, like setting a custom background image or color and setting a custom logo. Check the related API reference for more details.

**Next:** [Step 13: Margins and Paddings](../13/README.md "Our app content is still glued to the corners of the letterbox. To fine-tune our layout, we can add margins and paddings to the controls that we added in the previous step.")

**Previous:** [Step 11: Pages and Panels](../11/README.md "After all the work on the app structure itâ€™s time to improve the look of our app. We will use two controls from the sap.m library to add a bit more &quot;bling&quot; to our UI. You will also learn about control aggregations in this step.")
