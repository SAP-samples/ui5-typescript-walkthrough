## Step 34: Responsiveness

In this step, we improve the responsiveness of our app. OpenUI5 applications can be run on phone, tablet, and desktop devices and we can configure the application to make best use of the screen estate for each scenario. Fortunately, OpenUI5 controls like the `sap.m.Table` already deliver a lot of features that we can use.

### Coding


### webapp/i18n/i18n.properties

In this step we will exchange the list we used on the invoice list view by a responsive table. Obviously the column titles needs to be translatable texts. So we add a text value pair for quantity, name, supplier, status, and price to our resource bundle file.

```ini
...
# Invoice List
invoiceListTitle=Invoices
invoiceStatusA=New
invoiceStatusB=In Progress
invoiceStatusC=Done
columnQuantity=Quantity
columnName=Name
columnSupplier=Supplier
columnStatus=Status
columnPrice=Price

# Detail Page
...
```

***

### webapp/view/InvoiceList.view.xml

On the invoice list view, we exchange the list with a table simply by replacing the tag `<List>` with `<Table>`. The table has a built-in responsiveness feature that allows us to make the app more flexible. The table and the list share the same set of properties so we can simply reuse these and also the sorter.

Since a table has multiple cells in each row, we have to define columns for our table and name these according to the data. We add five `sap.m.Column` controls to the column aggregation and configure each one a bit differently:

-   **Quantity**

    This column will contain a short number, so we set the alignment to `End` \(which means "right" in LTR languages\) and the width to `5em` which is long enough for the column description. As a description text we use a `sap.m.Text` control that references a property of the resource bundle. We set the property `minScreenWidth` to `Small` to indicate that this column is not so important on phones. We will tell the table to display this column below the main column by setting the property `demandPopin` to `true`.

-   **Name**

    Our main column that has a pretty large **width** to show all the details. It will always be displayed.

-   **Status**

    The status is not so important, so we also display it below the `name` field on small screens by setting `minScreenWidth` to `small` and `demandPopin` to `true`

-   **Supplier**

    We completely hide the `Supplier` column on phone devices by setting `minScreenWidth` to `Tablet` and `demandPopin` to `false`.

-   **Price**
    This column is always visible as it contains our invoice price.

Instead of the `ObjectListItem` that we had before, we will now split the information onto the cells that match the columns defined above. Therefore we change it to a `ColumnListItem` control with the same attributes, but now with cells aggregation. Here we create five controls to display our data:

-   **Quantity**

    A simple `sap.m.ObjectNumber` control that is bound to our data field.

-   **Name**

    A `sap.m.ObjectIdentifier` control that specifies the name.

-   **Status**

    A `sap.m.Text control` with the same formatter as before.

-   **Supplier**

    A simple `sap.m.Text` control.

-   **Price**

    An `ObjectNumber` control with the same formatter as the attributes number and `numberUnit` from the previous steps.

```xml
<mvc:View
	controllerName="ui5.walkthrough.controller.InvoiceList"
	xmlns="sap.m"
	xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc">
	<Table
		id="invoiceList"
		class="sapUiResponsiveMargin"
		width="auto"
		items="{
				path : 'invoice>/Invoices',
				sorter : {
					path : 'ShipperName',
					group : true
				}
			}">
		<headerToolbar>
			<Toolbar>
				<Title text="{i18n>invoiceListTitle}" />
				<ToolbarSpacer />
				<SearchField
					width="50%"
					search=".onFilterInvoices"/>
			</Toolbar>
		</headerToolbar>
		<columns>
			<Column
				hAlign="End"
				minScreenWidth="Small"
				demandPopin="true"
				width="5em">
				<Text text="{i18n>columnQuantity}" />
			</Column>
			<Column>
				<Text text="{i18n>columnName}" />
			</Column>
			<Column
				minScreenWidth="Small"
				demandPopin="true">
				<Text text="{i18n>columnStatus}" />
			</Column>
			<Column
				minScreenWidth="Tablet"
				demandPopin="false">
				<Text text="{i18n>columnSupplier}" />
			</Column>
			<Column hAlign="End">
				<Text text="{i18n>columnPrice}" />
			</Column>
		</columns>
		<items>
			<ColumnListItem
				type="Navigation"
				press=".onPress">
				<cells>
					<ObjectNumber
						number="{invoice>Quantity}"
						emphasized="false"/>
					<ObjectIdentifier 
					  title="{invoice>ProductName}" />
					<Text
						text="{
					    path: 'invoice>Status',
							formatter: '.formatter.statusText'
						}"/>
					<Text text="{invoice>ShipperName}" />
					<ObjectNumber
						core:require="{
							Currency: 'sap/ui/model/type/Currency'
            }"
						number="{
							parts: [
								'invoice>ExtendedPrice',
								'view>/currency'
							],
							type: 'Currency',
							formatOptions: {
								showMeasure: false
							}
						}"
						unit="{view>/currency}"
						state="{= ${invoice>ExtendedPrice} > 50 ? 'Error' : 'Success' }"/>
				</cells>
			</ColumnListItem>
		</items>
	</Table>
</mvc:View>
```

Now we have defined our table responsively and can see the results when we decrease the browsers screen size. The *Supplier* column is not shown on phone sizes and the two columns *Quantity* and *Status* will be shown below the name.

We can see the results when we decrease the browser's screen size or open the app on a small device.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** <br>
> You can test the device specific features of your app with the developer tools of your browser. For example in Google Chrome, you can emulate a tablet or a phone easily and see the effects. Some responsive options of OpenUI5 are only set initially when loading the app, so you might have to reload your page to see the results.

### Conventions

-   Optimize your application for the different screen sizes of phone, tablet, and desktop devices.

**Next:** [Step 35: Routing and Navigation](../35/README.md "We now configure the visibility and properties of controls based on the device that we run the application on. By making use of the sap.ui.Device API and defining a device model we will make the app look great on many devices.")

**Previous:** [Step 33: Debugging Tools](../33/README.md "In this step, we are going to extend the functionality of OpenUI5 with a custom control. We want to rate the product shown on the detail page, so we create a composition of multiple standard controls using the OpenUI5 extension mechanism and add some glue code to make them work nicely together. This way, we can reuse the control across the app and keep all related functionality in one module.")
